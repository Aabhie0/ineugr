   ## Approach

1. Data Exploration     :     Here exploring dataset using pandas,numpy,matplotlib and seaborn. 

2. Data visualization   :     Plotted graphs to get insights about dependend and independed variables. 

3. Feature Engineering  :     All The Value Are Arrange In One Range.

4. Model Selection I    :     Tested all base models to check the base accuracy.
                       
5. Model Selection II   :     Performed Hyperparameter tuning using gridsearchCV.

6. Pickle File          :     Selected model as per best accuracy and created pickle file using Pickle .

7. Webpage & deployment :     Created a web form that takes all the necessary inputs from user and shows output.
                               We  Deploy at Heroku Platform

8. Algorithms :               Models to be optimised tuning to using algos
